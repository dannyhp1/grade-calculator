## Grade Calculator
A tool that provides students to calculate their current overall grade for a current class with ease. With each class having a unique grading scale, students may have a difficult time calculating their grade if no tools are provided. That's where Grade Calculator comes in! This tool is meant to be user-friendly, so it's the go-to tool use when it comes to grade calculation. In order for it to look 'decent,' Grade Calculator was built entirely with React.js. 


Currently deployed at: https://grade-calculator.netlify.com/


### To start development:

## Known bugs:
Grade Calculator is still in its development phase, so there are many bugs within the application.
- The design of the application (mostly responsive issues).
  - May not be fully responsive.
  - Categories are not aligned correctly (only fits 2 per row maximum).

## Future plans:
As you may have noticed, Grade Calculator is just a prototype. We plan to have the final version feature many more features.
- Deletion of categories.
- Deletion of certain assignments in each category.
- Editing the score & max score of each assignment.
- Grading Calculator for different classes (interchangable screens).
- Saving and loading up your grades (continually updating them).
