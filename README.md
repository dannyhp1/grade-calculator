## Grade Calculator
The grade calculator provides students with a tool to calculate their overall grade. Students are enrolled in several classes, so it can get difficult for them to calculate their grades without any tools. This is where the grade calculator excels! The tool is user-friendly and should be student's go-to when final season comes around.
